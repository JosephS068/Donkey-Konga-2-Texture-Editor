# Donkey-Konga-2-Texture-Editor

This is a simple program to edit .nut or namco texture.

Allows you to replace an image in a .nut file with another image of the exact same size.

Note that images with more than 256 colors may not work properly. Namco textures do support images with more than 256 images, but that specific format is not implemented here.

The program does have a simple algorithm that attempts to pair together similar colors so that some images with more than 256 colors can function properly.
