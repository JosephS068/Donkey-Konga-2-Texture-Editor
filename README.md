# Donkey Konga 2/3 Texture Editor

This program allows you to edit .nut files([Namco Texture](https://github.com/marco-calautti/Rainbow/wiki/NUT-File-Format#)).

Allows you to replace images in a .nut file so long as the new image is the exact same dimensions.

This project was made specifically for Donkey Konga 2, but Donkey Konga 3 has been tested and all texture files from both games can be viewed in this application. If other games use this file format they should also work.

This project was possible thanks to rainbow, it was a great resource in figuring out how to import textures and much of the code was lifted from the C# application:
